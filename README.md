# Drone Mission Deconfliction System

## Overview

- Detects and visualizes potential conflicts between multiple drone flight paths in 3D space and time.
- Ensures safe drone operations by identifying when and where drones might come too close to each other.

## Key Features

- Spatiotemporal conflict detection between multiple drone flight plans
- 3D visualization of drone trajectories and conflict points
- Time-based animations showing drone movements and potential conflicts
- Interactive 4D visualization with time slider for detailed analysis
- Configurable safety parameters (minimum safe distance and time threshold)
